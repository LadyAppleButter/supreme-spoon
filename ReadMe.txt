For tonight, we are going to format the third container.

Today:

Container 3
*formatted container 3; there will be revisions at the end but this is a promising start
*changed cite to section; cite have specific formatting requirements. Which ( at least for this project) is beyond what we need. 
*replace the word paragraph with the text located on the Full Design page
*altered the heigth and width of the child element
*left align section tag
*centered the child element (both horizontally and vertically).

Started the Landing page project of the Odin Foundation Course. 
Thinking 3 sittings to complete the project.
1. Set up the boxes for the content
2. Move the child boxes to the apportiate positions and add the necessary content
3. add the visualization to the page

Today:
*created repository landing-page with files landing_page.html*** and style.css
*We created a page with all the containers and the elements for the items to be added
**No actual content has been added nor any formatting or styling (thats next time)

landing_page.html

*set up html body
*broke the page into five sections ( 4 divs and a footer)
*created flex containers for each section
*created additional containers if needed for the given section
*added the elements that are needed to their respective containter
*connected style.css to landing_page.html

***There are two pages landing page.html and landing_page.html. We made an oopsie and added a space between 'landing page' and instead of renaming the file we created a new one.

style.css

**currently caption is formatted the same way, more likely to stay that way for the project
**tags are formatted the same and will change as the project progresses
**colors are this way so we can see changes, will correct coloring and formatting at the end of the project
